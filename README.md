# 2-to-4 Decoder Verilog Project

This repository contains the Verilog source code and testbench files for a 2-to-4 line decoder implemented using Verilog HDL.

## Files

- `decoder_2to4.v` : Verilog module implementing the 2-to-4 decoder.
- `tb_decoder_2to4.v` : Testbench for the 2-to-4 decoder to verify functionality.

## Description

A 2-to-4 decoder takes 2 input bits and decodes them into one of 4 outputs. Only one output is active at a time, corresponding to the binary value of the inputs.

This project includes:
- RTL design of the decoder
- Testbench to simulate and verify the behavior of the decoder

## How to Use

1. Compile both the `decoder_2to4.v` and `tb_decoder_2to4.v` files in your Verilog simulation tool.
2. Run the testbench to verify that the decoder outputs the correct signals based on input combinations.
